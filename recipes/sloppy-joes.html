    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This version of Sloppy Joes ups the nutrition ante by swapping the meat for lentils, and adding in extra veggies. Adjust this recipe to how you prefer your Sloppy Joes--make them sweeter with additional molasses, spicier with additional chili powder, or tangier with additional mustard. Serve warm, with your favorite rolls or buns, and top with sliced red onion and fresh spinach or lettuce, if desired.</h3>

        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup red lentils, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons molasses, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, 7 to 9 minutes. Season with chili powder, cumin, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper. Cook and stir for 30 seconds. Mix in tomato paste, and cook another 60 seconds, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Add water, diced tomatoes, and lentils, stirring to combine. Bring mixture to a gentle simmer, cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until lentils are tender, but not falling apart, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in molasses, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, vinegar, and salt. Cook, uncovered, an additional 10 minutes, or until mixture has thickened slightly. Taste, and adjust seasonings as needed. Allow to cool 5 minutes before serving on buns with desired toppings.</li>
